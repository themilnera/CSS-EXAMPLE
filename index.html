    <h1>CSS Basics</h1>

    <p>
      I didn't feel like going to get the default latin Lorem Ipsem whatever
      words, so I'm writing my own placeholder text here. This paragraph needs
      to be somewhat long so I can get the general sense of what this page looks
      like.

    <div>
      <h2>Another Heading</h2>
      <p>
        Yeah then it continues here, so what else am I supposed to write? I'm
        not sure, it's not worth the time to come up with something clever, I'm
        only doing this for demonstration purposes. This web page is being
        created as a CSS reference file, go check the style.css file, it's going
        to be filled with comments about CSS.
